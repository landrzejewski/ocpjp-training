# Exam Essentials

**Be able to write code that uses Java operators.**

This chapter covered a wide variety of operator symbols.

**Be able to recognize which operators are associated with which data types.**

Some operators may be applied only to numeric primitives, some only to boolean values, and some only to objects.
It is important that you notice when an operator and operand(s) are mis- matched, as this issue is likely to come up in
a couple of exam questions.

**Understand when casting is required or numeric promotion occurs.**

Whenever you mix operands of two different data types, the compiler needs to decide how to handle the resulting data
type. When you’re converting from a smaller to a larger data type, numeric promotion is automatically applied. When
you’re converting from a larger to a smaller data type, casting is required.

**Understand Java operator precedence.**

Most Java operators you’ll work with are binary, but the number of expressions is often greater than two. Therefore, you
must understand the order in which Java will evaluate each operator symbol.

**Be able to write code that uses parentheses to override operator precedence.**

You can use parentheses in your code to manually change the order of precedence.
