# Creating a main() Method

The main() method lets the JVM call our code. The simplest possible class with a main method looks like this;

```
public class Zoo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

To compile and execute this code ;

```
javac Zoo.java
java Zoo
```

To compile Java code with the javac command, the file must have the extension .java. The name of the file must match the
name of the public class. The result is a file of bytecode with the same name but with a .class filename extension.
Remember that bytecode consists of instructions that the JVM knows how to execute. Notice that we must omit the .class
extension to run Zoo.class.

- Each file can contain only one public class.
- The filename must match the class name, including case, and have .java extension.
- If the Java class is an entry point for the program, it must contain a valid main() method.

The main() method's parameter list, represented as an array of java.lang.String objects. You can use any valid variable
name along with any of these three formats:

- String[] args
- String options[]
- String... friends

**Optional Modifiers in main() Methods**

While most modifiers, such as public and static are required for main() methods, there are some optional modifiers
allowed.
Both final modifiers are optional.

```
public final static void main(final String[] args){
}
```

## Passing Parameters to a Java Program

```
public class Zoo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
        System.out.println(args[1]);
    }
}
```
```
javac Zoo.java
java Zoo Bronx Zoo
```

The program correctly identifies the first two "words" as the arguments. Spaces are used to separate the arguments.

The output is what you might expect:

```
Bronx
Zoo
```

```
javac Zoo.java
java Zoo "San Diego" Boo
```

Now we have a space in the output:

```
San Diego
Boo
```

**Single-File Source-Code**

If you get tired of typing both javac and java every time you want to try a code example, thereâ€™s a shortcut.You can
instead run

```
java Zoo.java Bronx Boo
```

There is a key difference here. When compiling first, you omitted the .java extension when running java. When skipping
the explicit compilation step, you include this extension. This feature is called launching single-file source-code
programs and is useful for testing or for small programs.
