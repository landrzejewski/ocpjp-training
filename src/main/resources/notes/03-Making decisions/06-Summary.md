# Summary

This chapter presented how to make intelligent decisions in Java.

We covered basic decision-making constructs such as if, else, and switch statements and showed how to use them to
change the path of the process at runtime. We also presented newer features in the Java language, including pattern
matching and switch expressions, both designed to reduce boilerplate code.

We then moved our discussion to repetition control structures, starting with while and do/while loops.

Next, we covered the extremely convenient repetition control structures: the for and for-each loops. While their syntax
is more complex than the traditional while or do/while loops, they are extremely useful in everyday coding and allow you
to create complex expressions in a single line of code.

We concluded this chapter by discussing advanced control options and how flow can be enhanced through nested loops
coupled with break, continue, and return statements.
